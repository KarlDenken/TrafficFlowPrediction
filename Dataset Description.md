# Dataset Description

> In this document, multiple frequently used datasets in traffic flow prediction will be introduced. They vary in their size, content, publicity and accessibility. A fraction of them are accompanied with visualizations. Besides, frequent measurements used will also be displayed along with the easy Python code.

## METR-LA

This dataset comes from the communications of the ACM, 2014 Big Data and Its Technical Challenges. Itâ€™s the speed captured from the loop detectors installed in the highway of Los Angeles County. There are **207** sensors and the data are collected for 4 months from May 1st 2012 to Jun 30th 2012. The data was processed into **5 min windows**. Thus for each day, there are **288 samples/day** . The file is stored in `.h5` file and should be opened with python module `hd5y`. The data can be read with the following code

```Python
# ## Read the meta_la data
data_path = 'DCRNN-master/data/METR-LA/df_highway_2012_4mon_sample.h5'
h5 = h5py.File(data_path, 'r')
data = h5['df']
speeds = data['block0_values'][:]
```

The structure of the h5 file is `df -> axis0/axis1/block0_items/block0_values`.The real life correspondence are illustrated with the following table:

| Name | Real life correspondence |
| ---- | ----|
| axis0 | (207, ) sensor_id |
| axis1 | (34272, ) time_stamp, start from |
| block0_items | |
| block0_values | |
